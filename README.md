# **Technical Indicators**
## **Momentum Based Indicators**
*Momentum Based Indicators are a type of technical indicator that measure the capacity of the price trend(slope of the line in layman's word) to sustain itself over a period of time. Momentum here refers to the inertia of the price trend to either continue rising or falling for a particular length of time, taking into account both price and volume information. There are 3 types of momentum indicators:-*<br/>
&emsp; * **Closing price compared to Previous Close**<br/>
&emsp; * **Closing price compared to Range**<br/>
&emsp; * **Closing price compared to Moving Average**<br/>
*which I will describe sequentially*.<br/>
### **Closing Price compared to Previous Close**
*Using such indicators, traders can identify momentum trading signals. They sought to see if the market was overbought or oversold at close and if it could change directions. Eg:-* <br/>
#### **RSI(Relative Strength Index)**
*RSI measures the speed and magnitude of a security's recent price changes to evaluate overvalued or undervalued conditions in the price. The RSI is displayed via an oscillator (a line on the graph) on a scale of 0 to 100. It can also indicate securities that may be primed for a trend reversal or corrective pullback in price. It can signal when to buy and sell. Traditionally, an RSI reading of 70 or above indicates an overbought situation. A reading of 30 or below indicates an oversold condition. Lets look at the formula:-*<br/>
&emsp; **RSI=100+100/1+RS**<br/>
*RSI uses 14 periods as default to calculate RS.*<br/>
&emsp; **RS=avg up/avg down=(prev avg up*13 + current up)/(prev avg down*13 +current down)**<br/> 
### **Closing Price compared to Range**
*This type of momentum technical indicator compares the current price action to how the market has behaved over a past period of time. These indicators try to show whether the market is stronger or weaker. Eg:-* <br/>
#### **Stochastic Oscillator**
*A stochastic oscillator is a momentum indicator comparing a particular closing price of a security to a range of its prices over a certain period of time. Stochastic oscillators tend to vary around
some mean price level since they rely on an asset's price history. Similar to RSI, it is used to generate overbought and oversold trading signals, utilizing a 0â€“100 bounded range of values, with measurements above 80 indicating that an asset is overbought and measurements below 20 indicating that it is oversold.*
* Stochastic oscillator charting generally consists of two lines: one reflecting the actual value of the oscillator for each session, and one reflecting its three-day simple moving average. Because
price is thought to follow momentum, the intersection of these two lines is considered to be a signal that a reversal may be in the works, as it indicates a large shift in momentum from day to
day. Divergence between the stochastic oscillator and trending price action is also seen as an important reversal signal. For example, when a bearish trend reaches a new lower low, but the
oscillator prints a higher low, it may be an indicator that bears are exhausting their momentum and a bullish reversal is brewing. Formula:-<br/>
&emsp; **%K=(C-L14/H14-L14)100**
## **Trend Following Indicators**
*Trend-following strategies are strategies where you simply ride the trend, i.e. buy when the price is going up and sell when the price starts going down (both for a prolonged time period). With
trend-following strategies, one does not aim to forecast or predict, but one simply needs to keep an eye on the market for any emerging trend. Trends emerge as a result of human emotion and the desire to follow the crowd since a group of people can base their trading decision on an emotion triggered by an event. And, the others follow! Types of trends:-*
* **Uptrend:-** An uptrend implies that the stock price is rising in value. In case of an uptrend, the traders aim to take advantage by entering the long position in order to sell it later at a high
price. For instance, if the price of a stock increases by $40 and reduces by $20, and then again rises by $25 to reach 45, the stock price is in an upward trend since it shows higher highs (the
increase in price is taking the price line towards upward direction more often) and higher lows (the occasional decrease in price is not taking the price line towards downward direction) in the
price.
* **Downtrend:-** In case of a downtrend, the stock price faces a fall in value. During the downtrend, the trend traders enter a short position. And, when the stock price seems to be
falling below the lowest possible point (which makes the price too less), the trend trader prefers selling the stocks and exiting the market. For instance, if the stock price decreases by $70 and
then increases by $40 and then again falls by $50 to reach $80, a trader will see a formation in a downward trend. It shows through the lower highs (the occasional increase in price is not
taking the price line towards upward direction) and lower lows (the decrease in price is taking the price line towards downward direction more often) in the stock price during a downtrend.
