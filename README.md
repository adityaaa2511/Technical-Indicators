# **MOMENTUM BASED INDICATORS**
*Momentum Based Indicators are a type of technical indicator that measure the capacity of the price trend(slope of the line in layman's word) to sustain itself over a period of time. Momentum here refers to the inertia of the price trend to either continue rising or falling for a particular length of time, taking into account both price and volume information. There are 3 types of momentum indicators:-*<br/>
&emsp; * **Closing price compared to Previous Close**<br/>
&emsp; * **Closing price compared to Range**<br/>
&emsp; * **Closing price compared to Moving Average**<br/>
*which I will describe sequentially*.<br/><br/>
## **Closing Price compared to Previous Close**
*Using such indicators, traders can identify momentum trading signals. They sought to see if the market was overbought or oversold at close and if it could change directions. Eg:-* <br/>
### **RSI(Relative Strength Index)**
*RSI measures the speed and magnitude of a security's recent price changes to evaluate overvalued or undervalued conditions in the price. The RSI is displayed via an oscillator (a line on the graph) on a scale of 0 to 100. It can also indicate securities that may be primed for a trend reversal or corrective pullback in price. It can signal when to buy and sell. Traditionally, an RSI reading of 70 or above indicates an overbought situation. A reading of 30 or below indicates an oversold condition. Lets look at the formula:-*<br/>
&emsp; **RSI=100+100/1+RS**<br/>
*RSI uses 14 periods as default to calculate RS.*<br/>
&emsp; **RS=avg up/avg down=(prev avg up*13 + current up)/(prev avg down*13 +current down)**<br/> 
## **Closing Price compared to Range**
*This type of momentum technical indicator compares the current price action to how the market has behaved over a past period of time. These indicators try to show whether the market is stronger or weaker. Eg:-* <br/>
### **Stochastic Oscillator**
*A stochastic oscillator is a momentum indicator comparing a particular closing price of a security to a range of its prices over a certain period of time. Stochastic oscillators tend to vary around
some mean price level since they rely on an asset's price history. Similar to RSI, it is used to generate overbought and oversold trading signals, utilizing a 0â€“100 bounded range of values, with measurements above 80 indicating that an asset is overbought and measurements below 20 indicating that it is oversold.*
* Stochastic oscillator charting generally consists of two lines: one reflecting the actual value of the oscillator for each session, and one reflecting its three-day simple moving average. Because
price is thought to follow momentum, the intersection of these two lines is considered to be a signal that a reversal may be in the works, as it indicates a large shift in momentum from day to
day. Divergence between the stochastic oscillator and trending price action is also seen as an important reversal signal. For example, when a bearish trend reaches a new lower low, but the
oscillator prints a higher low, it may be an indicator that bears are exhausting their momentum and a bullish reversal is brewing. Formula:-<br/>
