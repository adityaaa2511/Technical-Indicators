# **MOMENTUM BASED INDICATORS**
*Momentum Based Indicators are a type of technical indicator that measure the capacity of the price trend(slope of the line in layman's word) to sustain itself over a period of time. Momentum here refers to the inertia of the price trend to either continue rising or falling for a particular length of time, taking into account both price and volume information. There are 3 types of momentum indicators:-*<br/>
&emsp; * **Closing price compared to Previous Close**<br/>
&emsp; * **Closing price compared to Range**<br/>
&emsp; * **Closing price compared to Moving Average**<br/>
*which I will describe sequentially*.<br/><br/>
## **Closing Price compared to Previous Close**<br/>
*Using such indicators, traders can identify momentum trading signals. They sought to see if the market was overbought or oversold at close and if it could change directions.Eg:-* <br/>
### **RSI(Relative Strength Index)**<br/>
*RSI measures the speed and magnitude of a security's recent price changes to evaluate overvalued or undervalued conditions in the price. The RSI is displayed via an oscillator (a line on the graph) on a scale of 0 to 100. It can also indicate securities that may be primed for a trend reversal or corrective pullback in price. It can signal when to buy and sell. Traditionally, an RSI reading of 70 or above indicates an overbought situation. A reading of 30 or below indicates an oversold condition. Lets look at the formula:-*<br/>
&emsp; **RSI=100+100/1+RS**<br/>
*RSI uses 14 periods as default to calculate RS.*<br/>
&emsp; **RS=avg up/avg down=(prev avg up*13 + current up)/(prev avg down*13 +current down)**<br/>
